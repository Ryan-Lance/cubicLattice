This is a program I've been working on, it's a "spring model" of an atomic structure using classical physics. 

Right now, it uses Euler's method to update the positions of all the masses. My goal is to switch to Verlet's method, but it's been a while since I've worked on it so making changes isn't easy. I might end up keeping the Euler version as is, then basically restarting with Verlet. We'll see how that goes.
